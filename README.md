# ASSGM-3D

This repository contains the Anchored Self-Similar 3D Gauss-Markov Mobility Model (ASSGM-3D), which was introduced in our paper entitled "ASSGM-3D: Anchored Self-Similar 3D Gauss-Markov Mobility Model for Ad Hoc Routing Scenarios".

## Gaussian Randomness Index

This model relies on modifying the randomness index "a", using a set of new statistical metrics which are direct functions of the node's mobility and orientation in the x, y and z axis, as well as the cumulative rolling average and the rate of change thereof.
